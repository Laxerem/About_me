                    <p>I don't consider myself a real programmer, but I 
                        have some experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I discovered programming at 
                        the age of 13, the decision to become a programmer 
                        came to me suddenly, and I still can't explain 
                        exactly what made me do it, maybe I wanted to 
                        become like my brother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that you can understand how strange it is, at 
                        that time, I was studying at a music school, and 
                        everyone thought I was going to become a musician.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like it when I see the result of my work, and 
                        even though I often feel like I'm learning very 
                        slowly, I realize that I'm getting better.

                    <p>
                        I've been listening to music since I was a 
                        kid, and if I like music, I can imagine it 
                        in a variety of situations, which is why 
                        music sounds in almost all my videos: 
                        I adjust the video to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there were no music, 
                        I wouldn't be interested in making videos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started learning to play a musical instrument 
                        at the age of 11, the first year I went to a 
                        small amateur music group, later, my mother 
                        enrolled me in a music school, where I studied 
                        for 4 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, I couldn't finish my studies 
                        at a music school - I went to college, but to 
                        this day I'm learning new compositions, developing my 
                        skills.

                        Sometimes, I create music. I absolutely do not know how to use the program, 
                        despite the fact that the melody is usually in my head. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also noticed that it's difficult for me to create 
                        complete music - I "feel" too much, and feelings don't last forever, so as a rule, 
                        if I'm not done with music in one day, I'm unlikely to finish it.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, there is one finished track, made in 30 minutes, without effects, 
                        just a melody, if you want, you can listen to it

                        Sometimes, I create videos, and as I said before, 
                        I use some kind of music in most of the videos.
                        I have worked in programs such as: InShoot, Sony 
                        Vegas 13, Premier Pro, After Effects
                    </p>
                    <p>I don't own them at a professional level - I'm just an ordinary 
                        amateur, however, at the moment, I'm using Premier Pro.

                        The last video I made was a video for our graduation class (video in the background), and even though it 
                        wasn't shown on a projector in the great hall, my classmates liked the video.
